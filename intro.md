# AI Course Book

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence Course Book**! This comprehensive guide covers fundamental concepts in AI, from basic principles to advanced search algorithms and logical reasoning.

## Course Overview

This book is organized into six main chapters:

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Explore what AI is, its historical roots, and current applications across various industries.

### Chapter 2: Important Concepts in AI
Learn about agents, environments, constraint satisfaction problems, and the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning.

### Chapter 3: Searching State Spaces
Understand uninformed and informed search algorithms including DFS, BFS, A*, and local search techniques.

### Chapter 4: Multiagent Search
Discover how multiple agents interact in adversarial and cooperative environments, including minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search.

### Chapter 5: Propositional Logic
Master the fundamentals of logical reasoning, truth tables, and automated theorem proving.

### Chapter 6: First-Order Logic
Advance to first-order logic with quantifiers, predicates, and knowledge representation for expert systems.
